/*
responsive design notes: always think inside the box.
   everything you see on a website is just a box, everything can be broken down into rows and columns
   a responsive layout is essentially moving the elements around to fit different screen sizes
   
   flex: 1 1 auto; means the element can grow and shrink as needed, taking up available space
   this is the most used configuration for flexbox layouts 
   
   in grid layouts, you define rows and columns explicitly, giving you more control over placement and sizing of elements
   ex: display: grid;
       gap: 1rem;
       grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr; ->> 1fr 2fr divides the container into 2 parts of ratio 1 : 2

    if you want a flexible layout use flexbox, if you want a specific layout use grid


   it is better to first design the layout for multiple screens first, then adjust content within those layouts later
   
   media queries help you change the layout based on screen size, it works on different conditions like width, height, orientation, resolution, etc.
   
   use felxbox only until you can decide hat you need a grid layout

   position property is used to control the positioning of elements on a webpage. There are several values for the position property, 
   including: static, relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky.
