## Web App Fundamentals – Hackathon Prep

**WEEK 1**:<br>
This repo contains my daily progress while learning:

**Day 1**: HTML forms and inputs<br>
Built a complete HTML form using text, email, number, date, radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns, file upload, and specialized inputs such as phone, URL, color, and password. Implemented native form validation using required fields and input constraints. Connected the form to a results page to demonstrate an input to output flow by passing and displaying data via URL parameters. Practiced proper label associations and maintained clear, incremental Git commits.<br>
**Files:**

- [index.html](./index.html)
- [results.html](./results.html)


CSS flexbox and responsiveness

JavaScript DOM manipulation and events

Fetch API

Simple input → process → output apps

Each folder represents one day of learning.
